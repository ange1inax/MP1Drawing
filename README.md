// METHODS AND EXPLANATION
// The first method defintion creates a canvas under 'createcanvas' using a 2D array with dimensions height x width. The canvas is created with
// '+" in the corners and '=' which borders the canvas
//The canvas "frame" is created by the for loops that are initialized in the first method createCanvas 
// and setting the value of each element based on its position within the array.
// The first two for loops iterate to represent each row and column of the canvas.

// The last statement make sures that the canvas frame is counted as the position of the canvas so it can be
// drawn
// The completed canvas array is also returned from the method at the end


//  This method defnition adds a character value into the canvas based on the position by declaring 2 array brackets and int x and int y to
// declare positions on the canvas
 // In my drawing, I will be "drawing" out the phrase "Hi!"
// This is the main method where the chracters will be able to be inputed into the canvas using the addCharacter method.
//At the end, the for loop iterates into the canvas and prints out the new canvas
